"AboutUs" = "\rTechnologies change our world. Many things become more affordable and easy. Many things become more primitive and illusory. Today it is simpler to make a post, than to make a real deed. It is easier to put a \"like\", than to experience true emotions. Deep feelings depreciate in the speed of everyday information flow. \rLong ago our world has become virtual where it is more important to seem, than to be. We want to change this world by teaching technologies to understand the sensual side of a human being and having put the best manifestations of humanity in their basis. \rFor this purpose we have created something special – K.A.R.A. - the first digital life form that will be able to experience the emotions and to empathize the person. K.A.R.A., which will be capable to embody your feelings, representations and ideas in your digital reflection and to give them the immortality.";
